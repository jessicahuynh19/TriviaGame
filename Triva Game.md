The objective of this weeks assignment was to create a timed trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 

## Getting Started
You'll be creating a trivia form with multiple choice anwsers. The player will have 10 seconds to answer each question. The game ends when the time runs out and the last question is answered. At the end of the form results will be revealed showing the player the number of questions answered correctly and incorrectly. 

### Prerequisites
When using bootstrap you must add the content directory network url to your html, you can find the link needed via https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/
Visual Studio Code(or any code editor) 
jQuery: visit http://code.jquery.com/ and link in html

### Installing

When you have accessed the repository page on GitHub, you may simply download a Zip file and extract it to a directory of your choosing. Alternatively, you may download the data directly to your device via GitBash or Terminal if you have an SSH key. More on adding an SSH key can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

To download via GitBash/Terminal, once you have a working SSH key with GitHub, create a folder you wish to download data into. Next, click on the green 'Download or Clone' button on the GitHub respoitory page. Make sure you have SSH key selected(and not HTTPS), and click on the clipboard icon. This copies the address to your clipboard. Personally, I use SSH key but if you'd rather use HTTPS here is a link that will instruct you on using HTTPS over SSH https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use

Next, navigate to the folder you wish to download the data into via GitBash or Terminal, and then simply type "git clone" followed by the SSH or the HTTPS URL. Press the enter key, and GitBash/Terminal will pull the entire repository needed.


## Tips

Make sure you check out all the features of bootstrap. You can use https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/ for reference or go to https://getbootstrap.com/ to look at examples.
